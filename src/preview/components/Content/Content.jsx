        <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          As IBM’s official design system, Carbon serves a wide range of
          designers and developers building digital products and experiences. It
          is maintained by a core team of designers, developers, and writers
          based in the Austin, Texas IBM Design Studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and
          quality, making the design and development process more efficient and
          focused, establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and
          developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design
          and development best practices.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Guide">Guiding principles</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Carbon is open.</strong> The design system is a distributed
          effort, guided by the principles of the{" "}
          <Link to="#">open-source movement</Link>. Carbon’s users are also its
          makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Carbon is inclusive.</strong> It’s designed and built to be
          accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Governance">Governance</h2>
        <p>
          The Carbon team encourages adoption through guidance and training,
          community development, maintenance, and support. The system is
          primarily maintained by a core team and governed by an executive board
          of design advisors.
        </p>

        <h3>Adoption</h3>

          <strong>
            We conduct training classes and offer certifications.

          These cover introductions to Carbon and participating in this
          community. Each program is piloted internally and available upon
          release externally. We teach at conferences, bootcamp labs, and
          wherever else we’re needed.
